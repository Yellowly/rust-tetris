# rust-tetris

I got tired of all the popup advertisements on all the official tetris websites and apps, so I made my own. Also featuring lots of customization under the settings menu to the top right!

To go to the site, click the "github-pages" under Environments to the right, then "View Deployment", or [click here](https://yellowly.github.io/rust-tetris/).
